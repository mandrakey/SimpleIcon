<h1>SimpleIcon</h1>

<p>This project implements my <strong>SimpleIcon</strong> programming exercise in the language 
Rust (see <a href="https://rust-lang.org">https://rust-lang.org</a>). It uses 
Rusts native packaging helper <em>Cargo</em>. You can use it to compile the project, 
run the binary, create documentation and to clean the target directories.</p>
